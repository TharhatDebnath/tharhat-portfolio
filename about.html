                <p>I'm Tharhat, a 16-year-old Canadian-born individual navigating a journey of self-discovery, learning, and growth. Despite facing a combination of physical and mental health challenges, I remain committed to developing innovative projects and seeking personal improvement.</p>
                
                <p>I have a strong passion for technology, problem-solving, and finding ways to help others through the tools I create. My work revolves around making things better, simpler, and more accessible for those around me.</p>

                    <p>"One of the hardest things I've learned is how easy it is to hide pain. The ability to mask emotions behind a smile and say 'I'm fine' when I'm not is a difficult reality. I know what it feels like to plead silently for help, and I refuse to let others feel invisible or unheard."</p>
